No association detected between seven common variants in the CDKAL1 gene and gestational glycemic traits.
Elevated plasma glucose levels in pregnancy increase adverse pregnancy outcomes. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1) has been shown to be involved in insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells. In this study, we investigated the impact of genetic variants in CDKAL1 on plasma glucose, insulin values, β cell function and insulin resistance in the fasted state as well as plasma glucose 1 h after the consumption of a 50-g oral glucose load between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy among 929 unrelated pregnant Han Chinese women. Seven common variants previously reported to associate with diabetes were genotyped. Insulin resistance and β cell function were assessed by homeostasis model assessment. The genetic impacts were analyzed using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. The results showed that there was no significant association between any of the seven variants and those gestational glycemic traits. Therefore, this study suggests that the seven common variants in CDKAL1 are not significant factors for the variations of several gestational glycemic traits in the Han Chinese population. However, further well-designed studies with larger sample size, more ethnic groups and more CDKAL1 variants are required to validate the association between CDKAL1 and gestational glycemic traits.
