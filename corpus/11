Preliminary spectrum of genetic variants in familial hypercholesterolemia in Argentina.
BACKGROUND:
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and early cardiovascular disease. As cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in Argentina, early identification of patients with FH is of great public health importance.
OBJECTIVE:
The aim of our study was to identify families with FH and to approximate to the characterization of the genetic spectrum mutations of FH in Argentina.
METHODS:
Thirty-three not related index cases were selected with clinical diagnosis of FH. Genetic analysis was performed by sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and bioinformatics tools.
RESULTS:
Twenty genetic variants were identified among 24 cases (73%), 95% on the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene. The only variant on APOB was the R3527Q. Four were novel variants: c.-135C>A, c.170A>C p.(Asp57Ala), c.684G>C p.(Glu228Asp), and c.1895A>T p.(Asn632Ile); the bioinformatics' analysis revealed clear destabilizing effects for 2 of them. The exon 14 presented the highest number of variants (32%). Four variants were observed in more than 1 case and the c.2043C>A p.(Cys681*) was carried by 18% of index cases. Two true homozygotes, 3 compound heterozygotes, and 1 double heterozygote were identified.
CONCLUSION:
This study characterizes for the first time in Argentina genetic variants associated with FH and suggest that the allelic heterogeneity of the FH in the country could have 1 relative common low-density lipoprotein receptor mutation. This knowledge is important for the genotype-phenotype correlation and for optimizing both cholesterol-lowering therapies and mutational analysis protocols. In addition, these data contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of FH in Argentina.
